# EdX promptengineering code

This is a private repository I use to test out langchain's library to construct prompts to format OpenAI's output to something that can be consumed by code.

The example code is based on EdX's Course on [AI Applications and Prompt Engineering](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:edX+BC-OC-ai+2T2023/home)

If you are interested in utilizing OpenAI's API through langchain, check out the course here:
